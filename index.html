                 <h4 style="position: relative; top: 10px"><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></h4>
                 <p>What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every email i've ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. And through his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed ,Mr Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.</p><figcaption style="position: relative; bottom: 5px;">Janna from Seattle, WA</figcaption><br>

                 <h4 style="position: relative; top: 10px"><strong>He's gone...</strong></h4>
                 <p>A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but I felt I knew him. I will forever remember him. I'm still saddened because he was taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly gained an angel.</p><figcaption style="position: relative; bottom: 5px;">Anonymous</figcaption><br>

For me Apple means a lot - I got a good job using Apple products, I hav found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple, and of course, I've been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is connected with Steve. I do hope he'll be rememberd around the world as a genius.</p><figcaption style="position: relative; bottom: 5px;">Eugene</figcaption><br>

                 <p>My thoughts and prayer are with you all tonight. The company Steve started has touched the lives of many in this world and he will be missed. I know he will live on in the spirit, through the lives of all who knew him well. As a sign of respect for Steve, I will be turning my iPhone,iPod, and iPad off for one hour. May Steve rest in peace.</p><figcaption style="position: relative; bottom: 5px;">Zachary</figcaption><br><hr style="width: 666px;position: relative; right: 100px;">
